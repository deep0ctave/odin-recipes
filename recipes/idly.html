    <h1>Idly</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cup rice</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>5 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup urad dal</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>water as required</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl or pan take 1 cup parboiled rice and 1 cup regular rice. Here I have used the Indian variety of sona masuri rice along with parboiled rice. </li>
        <li>Pick and then rinse both the rice varieties a couple of times in fresh water. Drain all the water and keep it aside.</li>
        <li>Take ¼ cup thick poha (flattened rice or parched rice) in a bowl. Poha helps in making the idli soft and fluffy. If you don’t have poha then you can skip it.</li>
        <li>Rinse the poha once or twice with fresh water.</li>
        <li>Then add the poha to the rice. Add 2 cups of water. Mix very well and keep aside covered to soak for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl take ½ cup urad dal (husked black gram) along with ¼ teaspoon fenugreek seeds.</li>
        <li>Rinse a couple of times in fresh water.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup water. Cover and soak for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Before grinding, drain the water from urad dal, but don’t throw away the water. Reserve the soaked water as we will be using this water for grinding or you can use fresh water for grinding.</li>
        <li>In a wet grinder jar, add the urad dal. Initially add ¼ cup of the reserved water or fresh water.</li>
        <li>And grind the urad dal for some seconds. Then add ¼ cup of the reserved soaked water or fresh water and continue to grind. The batter should be light and fluffy when completely ground.</li>
        <li>Pour the urad dal batter in a deep pan or bowl.</li>
        <li>Drain the water from the rice and poha. Add them in the wet grinder jar or in a powerful blender. I usually grind in two batches. </li>
        <li>Use the reserved urad dal strained water or regular fresh water to grind the rice and poha too. Add water in parts and grind. </li>
        <li>Now pour the rice batter in the bowl containing the urad dal batter.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon of rock salt. Mix very well with a spoon or spatula. If you live in a cool or cold region, then do not add salt. Add salt later once the fermentation is done. </li>
        <li>Cover the bowl or container with a lid and keep the batter in a warm place. It should be left undisturbed for 8 to 9 hours. Don’t use an air-tight lid. In colder climate, keep the batter for a longer time – from 12 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Grease or brush the idli mould with oil all over evenly. Gently and lightly swirl the batter. Don’t overdo. Now with a spoon pour portions of the batter in the greased idli moulds.</li>
        <li>Take your idli steamer or pressure cooker or electric cooker or Instant pot. Add some 2 to 2.5 cups water and heat the water until it comes to a light boil. Keep the idli mould in the steamer or pressure cooker. Steam for 12 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Check for doneness by carefully inserting a bamboo skewer or knife. If it does not come out clean, then keep again for a few more minutes. </li>
        <li>Serve Idli hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney.</li>
