    <hr />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew). Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Urad dal</li>
        <li>Chana dal</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Methi</li>
        <li>Poha</li>
        <li>Cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice.</li>
        <li>To the same bowl, add ¼ cup urad dal and ⅛ teaspoon fenugreek seeds.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice, lentils and methi seeds together a couple of times and keep them aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, take 2 tablespoons of thick poha.</li>
        <li>Rinse poha once or twice in water and then add to the bowl containing the rinsed rice+lentils+methi seeds.</li>
        <li>Add 1.5 cups of water and mix. Cover with a lid and soak everything for 4 to 5 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain all the water and add the soaked ingredients to a mixer grinder or a blender.</li>
        <li>Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind or blend till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. </li>
        <li>Now take the batter in a large bowl or pan. In case the dosa batter becomes thin, then add a few tablespoons of rice flour to thicken it. Mix the rice flour very well in the batter.</li>
        <li>Add ½ teaspoon of edible rock salt. Mix very well. Instead of rock salt, you can use non-iodized salt or sea salt crystals or Himalayan pink salt. </li>
        <li>Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. The time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions, climate and altitude. </li>
        <li>Now lightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa. You will also see many tiny air pockets in the batter. </li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan with a spoon or with a thick paper towel dipped in oil. For a richer taste, you can cook the dosa with ghee or butter. </li>
        <li>Now take a ladle full of the dosa batter or about ¼ cup of the batter. Pour the batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards. </li>
        <li>Cook the dosa on low to medium heat. Do regulate the heat as per the pan size and thickness. </li>
        <li>Cook till the base is nicely golden and crisp. The base will leave the pan and the edges separate when it gets cooked.</li>
